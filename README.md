# first-react-button

First react project: just a simple button that prompts and closes an alert

I followed the youtube tutorial by Programming with Mosh: This stutorial went in depth on creating a new React project, creating components and making them useful in the app, and many more things. We coded this project using Bootstrap and TypeScript. Below are a couple takeaways for me:

## Setup

This tutorial started from the beggining: making a React project with Vite. I learned how to configure the project and get started with the files included in the Vite API. From there, I made the neccesary changes needed in order to run Bootstrap in my app, and started the app from there.

## Components

I learned quite a bit about React components and how to implement them in an app. For starters, I learned that components are what make up a React app: they are the building blocks for applications that run on React. I learned how to use Bootstrap docs: getting behind the documentation and working through it to find solutions to my problems. I also learned about interfaces and variables in TypeScript during this project.

Overall this was a great starter project and helped me get a vague grasp on what React is, how it functions, and a good introduction into TypeScript.
